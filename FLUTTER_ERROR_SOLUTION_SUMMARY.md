# Flutter Build Error - Solution Summary

## Problem
Your Flutter app fails to build with the error:
```
lib/shared/models/product.dart:129:12: Error: Method not found: '_$ProductFromJson'.
```

## Quick Fix (Windows)

### Option 1: Use the automated script
1. Copy `fix_flutter_build.bat` to your project: `C:\Users\Zkratos\Desktop\agrihub\`
2. Run it:
```cmd
fix_flutter_build.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual commands
Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Zkratos\Desktop\agrihub
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run -d ZY22D54TZZ
```

## Why This Happens
The `json_serializable` package in Flutter generates helper methods like `_$ProductFromJson` and `_$ProductToJson` automatically. These are created in `.g.dart` files (e.g., `product.g.dart`).

When you:
- Clone a new repository
- Switch branches
- Add/modify model classes with `@JsonSerializable()` annotations
- Delete generated files

...you need to regenerate these files using `build_runner`.

## What Each Command Does

1. **`flutter clean`** - Removes build artifacts and caches
2. **`flutter pub get`** - Installs/updates dependencies from pubspec.yaml
3. **`flutter pub run build_runner build`** - Generates the missing `.g.dart` files
4. **`--delete-conflicting-outputs`** - Overwrites existing generated files if they conflict

## Verification
After running the fix, you should see:
- A file created: `lib/shared/models/product.g.dart`
- The build should succeed without errors
- Your app should launch on the device

## For Future Development
To avoid this issue when actively developing:

**Use watch mode** - automatically regenerates code when you save files:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Keep this running in a separate terminal while you code.

2. `fix_flutter_build.bat` - Windows automated fix script
3. `fix_flutter_build.sh` - Linux/Mac automated fix script
